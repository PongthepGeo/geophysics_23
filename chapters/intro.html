<h3>1) When Geophysics Shine?</h3>
<p>
Geosciences are a field that combines various disciplines, with geology and geophysics being two of its essential components. To understand the surface of the Earth, geological studies are crucial, which involve analyzing sedimentary rocks, interpreting structural features, and exploring the processes that shape our landscapes. These methods help us create a detailed narrative of surface phenomena, and this observation is a piece of evidence that can lead to the subsurface of the Earth's image.

After collecting data, geophysics will use appropriate geophysical methods for each prospect, like potential field surveys and seismic explorations. These techniques offer a more direct view of the subsurface, generating precise and quantitative images that bridge the gap between surface observations and subsurface realities, overcoming the limitations of geological predictions.

<h3>2) Geologists Hand Over Information to Geophysicists: Streamlining the Exploration Process</h3>
<p>
Geologists and geophysicists play complementary roles in geoscientific exploration. Geologists construct comprehensive geological maps highlighting lithological formations, tectonic structures, rock formations, and potential mineral and hydrocarbon prospects. However, the limitation lies in their inability to pinpoint these subsurface prospects' locations precisely.

Geophysicists step in at this stage, using the geological maps to scope out prospective areas. While these maps set the stage, geophysicists utilize specific geophysical methods to locate targets quantitatively.

Seismic, gravity, and magnetic surveys are a few examples of such techniques. Seismic surveys provide a detailed view of subsurface layers, useful for oil and gas exploration. Gravity surveys help detect density variations indicative of ore deposits, while magnetic surveys reveal anomalies caused by magnetic minerals, assisting in mapping rock distribution and ore location. Each method enhances the precision of prospect identification, demonstrating the effective integration of geology and geophysics in the exploration process.

<h4>2.1) Unearthing the Unseen: The Role and Limitations of Geological Mapping in Depositional Environment</h4>
<p>
Geological mapping, a fundamental tool in earth sciences, forms the bedrock of our understanding of subsurface structures and strata. The overarching purpose of this technique is to delineate a big picture of the deposition environment. These environments, which include various types such as alluvial, lacustrine, fluvial, eolian, deltaic, shallow marine, deep marine, and glacial settings, can be inferred from the kinds of rocks and their distribution. The geological deposition environment, in turn, strongly influences the type and location of minerals and hydrocarbons deposited. Over time, these resources are buried, resulting in subsurface deposits. Geological mapping aids in uncovering the spatial distribution of these deposits, offering invaluable insight for exploration geologists.

However, while geological mapping can provide extensive surface information, its potential to illuminate subsurface details is only limited by additional techniques. Despite its ability to generate hypotheses about what lies beneath the surface based on surface observations, it cannot directly observe the targets hidden beneath the subsurface strata. Figure 1 demonstrates that a geologist can approximately locate a prospect in the Earth's strata.

<h4>2.2) Probing the Subsurface: The Crucial Role of Source Forms in Geophysical Methods</h4>
<p>
Humans traditionally perceive the physical world through our senses, with vision playing a pivotal role. Sight, as we understand it, fundamentally operates on the interaction of light - a type of electromagnetic wave - with objects. When light waves encounter an object, they are absorbed, refracted, reflected, or transmitted depending on the object's properties. This interaction results in the visual representation of objects that our brains interpret from the signals received by our eyes.

While the visible light spectrum plays an instrumental role in human vision, it is only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, spanning radio waves to gamma rays. Moreover, not all electromagnetic wavelengths have the ability to penetrate through Earth's various media. For instance, X-rays and gamma rays, despite their high energy, are largely absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. On the other hand, certain lower-frequency waves, such as radio waves, can penetrate deeper, but their resolution is too coarse for detailed subsurface investigation. 

To overcome these limitations, geophysicists use other forms of energy waves, such as seismic, gravity, and magnetic waves. These waveforms have unique propagation characteristics, which allow them to penetrate deeper into the Earth's media, thereby providing a means to probe and explore subsurface structures. Seismic waves, generated by earthquakes or artificial sources, travel through different layers of the Earth and are detected by seismometers on the surface. Gravity surveys measure variations in Earth's gravitational field to detect changes in subsurface density. Magnetic surveys are used to detect variations in the Earth's magnetic field that may indicate the presence of mineral deposits or other geological anomalies.

The selection of the appropriate source type for geophysical surveys depends on the specific requirements of the investigation, including the desired depth of investigation, resolution, and the type of geological features of interest. With a deep understanding of the physics behind each technique, geophysicists are able to interpret the data collected from these surveys to 'see' what lies beneath the surface, much like how we use light to see the world around us.

        Geophysics employs sophisticated techniques for investigating the Earth's subsurface, allowing us to understand geological structures and processes beneath our feet without physically digging into the ground. This technique can achieve by sending energy waves into the subsurface, which reflect, refract, or are absorbed by various geological features, creating signals that can be detected and interpreted at the surface and not limited to measuring potential field.
