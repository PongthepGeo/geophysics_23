<h4>1.1) The Law of Universal Gravitation</h4>
<p>
Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was born in the same year
in which Galileo died. Unlike Galileo, who relished
debate, Newton was a retiring person and avoided con-
frontation. His modesty is apparent in a letter written in
1675 to his colleague Robert Hooke, famous for his exper-
iments on elasticity. In this letter Newton made the
famous disclaimer “if I have seen further (than you and
Descartes) it is by standing upon the shoulders of
Giants.” In modern terms Newton would be regarded as a
theoretical physicist. He had an outstanding ability to
synthesize experimental results and incorporate them
into his own theories. Faced with the need for a more
powerful technique of mathematical analysis than existed
at the time, he invented diﬀerential and integral calculus,
for which he is credited equally with Gottfried Wilhelm
von Leibnitz (1646–1716) who discovered the same
method independently. Newton was able to resolve many
issues by formulating logical thought experiments; an
example is his prediction that the shape of the Earth is an
oblate ellipsoid. He was one of the most outstanding syn-
thesizers of observations in scientific history, which is
implicit in his letter to Hooke. His three-volume book
Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published
in 1687, ranks as the greatest of all scientific texts. The
first volume of the Principia contains Newton’s famous
Laws of Motion, the third volume handles the Law of
Universal Gravitation.

The first two laws of motion are generalizations from
Galileo’s results. As a corollary Newton applied his laws
of motion to demonstrate that forces must be added as
vectors and showed how to do this geometrically with a
parallelogram. The second law of motion states that the
rate of change of momentum of a mass is proportional
to the force acting upon it and takes place in the direction
of the force. For the case of constant mass, this law serves
as the definition of force $\mathbf{F}$ in terms of the acceleration
$\mathbf{a}$ given to a mass $m$:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{green}\mathbf{F}} = m{\color{green}\mathbf{a}} \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq1"></div>

The unit of force in the SI system of units is the
newton $(N)$. It is defined as the force that gives a mass of
one kilogram $(1\ kg)$ an acceleration of $1\ ms^2$.
His celebrated observation of a falling apple may be a
legend, but Newton’s genius lay in recognizing that the
type of gravitational field that caused the apple to fall was
the same type that served to hold the Moon in its orbit
around the Earth, the planets in their orbits around the
Sun, and that acted between minute particles characterized
only by their masses. If consider the Earth and falling apple as two particles, or point
masses $m$ and $M$ separated by a distance $r$, we
get for the gravitational attraction $F$ exerted by $M$ on $m$

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{green}\mathbf{F}} =G\times \frac{mM}{r^{2}} \times {\color{green}\mathbf{\hat{r}}} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq2"></div>

In this equation $r̂$ is a unit vector in the direction of
increase in coordinate $r$, which is directed away from the
center of reference at the mass $M$. The negative sign in the
equation indicates that the force $F$ acts in the opposite
direction, toward the attracting mass $M$. The constant $G$,
which converts the physical law to an equation, is the constant of universal gravitation.

There was no way to determine the gravitational constant experimentally during Newton’s lifetime. The
method to be followed was evident, namely to determine
the force between two masses in a laboratory experiment.
However, seventeenth century technology was not yet up
to this task. Experimental determination of $G$ was
extremely diﬃcult, and was first achieved more than a
century after the publication of Principia by Lord
Charles Cavendish (1731–1810). From a set of painstaking measurements of the force of attraction between two spheres of lead, Cavendish in 1798 determined the value
of $G$ to be $6.754\times 10^{11} \ m^{3} \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}$. A modern value
(Mohr and Taylor, 2005) is $6.674\ 210\ \times 10^{11} \ m^{3} \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}$.
It has not yet been possible to determine G more precisely,
due to experimental diﬃculty. Although other physical
constants are now known with a relative standard uncer-
tainty of much less than $1 \times 10^6$, the gravitational constant is known to only $150 \times 10^6$.

<h5>1.1.1) Utilizing Newton's Universal Gravitation Law in Geophysics: Assumptions and Applications</h5>
<p>
To harness the power of Newton's universal law, (<a href="#eq2">Equation 2</a>), of gravitation in geophysical investigations, we must establish certain fundamental assumptions. Primarily, we must consider the observation point and the object of interest (the target) as discrete point masses. This reduction allows us to bypass the complexities of multipoint mass attractions. Moreover, we must regard the Earth's strata as possessing a significantly lower mass than the target. This simplification allows us to approach the geophysical challenges with less computational complexity, enabling the application of point mass approximations in our calculations, as depicted in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Note that these assumptions are still impractical for building a gravitational device.

<h4>1.2) Gravitational Acceleration</h4>
<p>
In physics the field of a force is often more important than the absolute magnitude of the force. The field is defined as the force exerted on a material unit. For example, the electrical field of a charged body at a certain position is the force it exerts on a unit of electrical charge at that location. The gravitational field in the vicinity of an attracting mass is the force it exerts on a unit mass. <a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a> shows that this is equivalent to the acceleration vector.
    
In geophysical applications we are concerned with accelerations rather than forces. By comparing Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) we get the gravitational acceleration $g$ of the mass $m$ due to the attraction of the mass $M$:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{green}\mathbf{g}} =-G\times \frac{M}{r^{2}} \times {\color{green}\mathbf{\hat{r}}} \tag{3}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq3"></div>

The SI unit of acceleration is the $m \cdot s^{-2}$; this unit is
unpractical for use in geophysics. In the now superseded
c.g.s. system the unit of acceleration was the $cm \cdot s^{-2}$,
which is called a gal in recognition of the contributions of
Galileo. The small changes in the acceleration of gravity
caused by geological structures are measured in thousandths of this unit, i.e., in milligal (mgal). Until recently, gravity anomalies due to geological structures were surveyed with field instruments accurate to about one-tenth of a milligal, which was called a gravity unit. Modern
instruments are capable of measuring gravity diﬀerences
to a millionth of a gal, or microgal (mgal), which is
becoming the practical unit of gravity investigations. The
value of gravity at the Earth’s surface is about $9.8 \ m \cdot s^{-2}$,
and so the sensitivity of modern measurements of gravity
is about $1$ part in $109$.
</p>

<h5>1.2.1) Gravimeter: Absolute Gravity</h5>
<p>
In the design of gravimeters, practical measurements typically hinge on the acceleration of the free-fall object rather than directly on force. This practical approach employs <a href="#eq3">Equation 3</a>, enabling the computation of gravitational acceleration. Essentially, this translates into assessing variations in gravity from a predetermined reference level.

For application in exploration geophysics, Eq. (3) needs to be simplified. The gravity term $g$ is substituted with $\delta g$ because of the tiny changes in gravity accerlation caused by the Earth's strata. Newton's original conception of planetary orbits in gravity attraction is significantly larger if compared with the internal Earth's crusts, so the gravity unit is implemented here. The negative sign in $-G$ is typically disregarded because most scenarios in exploration geophysics occur within the subsurface and the absolute direction of gravity points toward the Earth's cores. In a number of measurements, the unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ can be assumed to be $1$ to avoid computation complexity. The target $M$ can be replaced with $\Delta M$, indicating that the density contrasts between the rock and its host is large enough to produce a distinguishable "anomaly." Thus, the Eq. (3) reformulates to <a href="#eq4">Equation 4</a> and $\Delta M$ can relate to $\delta \rho \times v$. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\delta g=G\times \frac{\Delta M}{r^{2}} =\frac{G}{r^{2}} \times \delta \rho \times v \tag{4}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq4"></div>

$$
\begin{align*}
\delta g\  & =gravity\ attraction\ between\ weight\ drop\ and\ rocks\\
G\  & =universal\ gravitational\ constant\ \left( 6.674\times 10^{-11} ,\ m^{3} \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}\right)\\
\Delta M\  & =mass\ contrast\ between\ rock\ and\ its\ host\\
r\  & =distance\ between\ the\ rock\ and\ weight\ drop\\
\delta \rho \  & =density\ contrast\\
v\  & =volume\ of\ the\ rock

        While direct measurement of force attraction can be used to detect subsurface anomalies, it often presents challenges in terms of device creation. Consequently, measuring changes in weight attributable to gravitational acceleration can be a more practical method. This approach simplifies the design and construction of a gravimeter, a device used for these measurements.

<h5>1.2.2) Gravity Unit in Exploration Geophysics</h5>

mGal: The unit '$mGal$' stands for milligal and is a unit of acceleration used in gravimetry. 1 mGal is one-thousandth of a gal, or $10^{-3} cm/s^{2}$. A gal (Galileo) is a non-SI unit of acceleration used in gravimetry and is defined as 1 centimeter per second squared ($cm/s^{2}$). The mGal is a more precise unit and is commonly used in exploration geophysics because the variations in the earth's gravitational field are usually very small and are often in the order of milligals.

$ms^{-2}$: This is the SI unit for acceleration, meters per second squared ($ms^{-2}$). In the context of exploration geophysics, it is used for expressing the acceleration due to gravity. The standard acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is approximately 9.81 $ms^{-2}$. However, this value varies slightly across the surface of the Earth due to changes in altitude, latitude, and local geological conditions. Because the variations in gravity are often much smaller than 1 $ms^{-2}$, it is more common to use the mGal unit in exploration geophysics.

<h4>1.3) The Earth's Figure and Gravity</h4>

<h5>1.3.1) Earth's Gravitational Models</h5>

The World Geodetic System, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS84">WGS 84</a> model, serves as a predominant framework for computing the Earth's surface gravity. Assuming the Earth as a perfect homogeneous sphere, as illustrated in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>, facilitates an exploration of the relationship between surface gravity and distance from the Earth's center, delineated in <a href="#eq3">Equation 3</a>. For the purpose of these calculations, a unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ is considered to have a value of $1$.

<figure id="fig5">
    <div style="padding: 20px 0;">

</figure>

This assumption reduces the complexity of the Earth's figure in the form of a point mass equation. Let's try to compute the gravity deduction with increasing distance from the Earth center using Python's snippet here. 

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = 6.674*pow(10, -11)
m = 5.972*pow(10, 24)
meter = pow(10, 6)
r = np.array([6.3781*meter, 6.3881*meter, 6.4781*meter, 100*meter])
f_1 = (G*m)/pow(r, 2)
dis = np.linspace(6.3*meter, 100*meter, 100)
f_2 = (G*m)/pow(dis, 2)

_, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, figsize=(10, 5), tight_layout=True)
ax.ticklabel_format(useOffset=False, style='plain')
plt.scatter(r, f_1, s=500, c='red', marker='o', edgecolor='black')

```

While the Earth's shape is often idealized as a perfect sphere, in reality, it more closely resembles an oblate spheroid. The World Geodetic System, particularly the WGS 84 model, provides estimations on how the distance from the Earth's center varies with latitude. This relationship is graphically represented in <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>.

<figure id="fig6">

<h5>1.3.2) Gravity at Earth's Surface Based on Ellipsoidal Geometry</h5>

By employing the parametric <a href="#eq5">Equation 5</a> to describe this elliptical form, and integrating with the principles laid out in <a href="#eq3">Equation 3</a>, one can derive an approximation for how the gravitational force on the Earth's surface varies with latitude. This variation is illustrated in <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>. These parametric equations are a general representation of an ellipse where 
$a$ and $b$ determine its shape and size. Here, **a** and **b** are the semi-major and semi-minor axes respectively, or vice-versa depending on which is greater.

- If **a > b**, then the ellipse is stretched more along the x-axis and **a** represents the semi-major axis.
- If **b > a**, then the ellipse is stretched more along the y-axis and **b** represents the semi-major axis.

$$
x=a\cdotp cos( \theta )\\
y=b\cdotp sin( \theta ) \tag{5}
$$

<h5>1.3.3) Gravitational Vector: Point Mass</h5>

Gravity, being a force, inherently has both magnitude and direction. Considering it as a vector rather than an absolute value (scalar) is crucial for accurately describing its effects on objects. The direction of the gravitational force is essential for calculating the gravitational tensor and can provide inside information on gravitational anisotropy. In addition, it is crucial in situations where multiple forces are acting on an object, as the net force is the vector sum of all individual forces.

<h5>1.3.4) Spherical Model for Depth and Target Size Analysis</h5>

The theoretical computation of gravitational attraction induced by a subsurface anomaly can be ascertained using <a href="#eq3">Equation 3</a>. Generally, the spatial variations of gravity in the x and y axes are negligible, and most gravimeters are not designed to detect them. The most substantial gravitational force occurs along the z-axis, directed towards the Earth's core. This is due to the mass distribution within the Earth, with density variations and anomalies contributing to the changes in the gravitational field.

1. $m_{sphere}$: This is the mass of the sphere, which is calculated by multiplying the volume of the sphere $v$ by the change in density $\Delta \rho_{contrast}$ between the sphere and its surrounding medium. The volume of a sphere is given by $\frac{4}{3} \pi R^3$, where $R$ is the radius of the sphere.

2. $cos(\theta)$: This is the cosine of the angle $\theta$ between the radial line $r$ from the center of the sphere to the observation point and the vertical $z$ axis.

3. $\Delta g_{z}$: This is the change in the gravitational field in the z-direction at the observation point due to the presence of the sphere.

4. $\Delta g_{net}$: This is the net change in the gravitational field at the observation point due to the presence of the sphere.

5. $G$: This is the gravitational constant.

6. $r$: This is the radial distance from the center of the sphere to the observation point. It is calculated as $\sqrt{x^2 + z^2}$, where $x$ is the horizontal distance from the center of the sphere to the observation point and $z$ is the vertical distance from the center of the sphere to the observation point.

7. $\Delta g_{z}$: The final expression for $\Delta g_{z}$ is the change in the gravitational field in the z-direction at the observation point due to the presence of the sphere. It is calculated by multiplying the net change in the gravitational field $\Delta g_{net}$ by the cosine of the angle between the radial line and the vertical axis $\cos(\theta) = \frac{z}{r}$, and substituting $\Delta g_{net}$ by $\frac{G m_{sphere}}{r^2}$.

The final equation for $\Delta g_{z}$ expresses the change in the gravitational field in the z-direction at the observation point due to a sphere of radius \(R\), density contrast $\Delta \rho_{contrast}$, and located at a distance $\sqrt{x^2 + z^2}$ from the observation point. Using the code snippet below to compute the gravitational attraction in one point observation in z-axis.

<h5>1.3.5) Gravitational Acceleration and Potential</h5>

The law of superposition is a fundamental principle in various branches of physics, and gravitation is no exception. In the context of gravitation, the principle asserts that the gravitational force or acceleration due to multiple point masses is essentially the vector sum of forces or accelerations produced by each point mass. While this approach requires vectorial manipulations, gravitation can be alternatively conceptualized as a scalar field, a perspective that offers a more straightforward treatment of diverse mass distributions.

By incorporating the concept of gravitational potential, we can refine our understanding. The gravitational potential at a point in space, due to a point mass, represents the work done in bringing a unit mass from infinity to that point against gravitational forces. When dealing with multiple point masses, the total gravitational potential at a given location is simply the algebraic sum (or scalar sum) of the potentials due to each of these masses. This scalar approach aligns with the law of superposition, suggesting that the effects of individual masses are additive.

This scalar perspective, encapsulated by gravitational potential, is particularly convenient. It bypasses the intricacies of vector operations and provides a direct, additive method to account for gravitational influences of complex and arbitrary mass distributions. By focusing on gravitational potential, we can grasp the cumulative effect of numerous point masses or continuous mass distributions more effortlessly than individually vector-summing the forces or accelerations they induce.

$$
V_{g} =G\int _{mass}\frac{\partial m}{r} \approx G\sum _{j}\frac{m_{j}}{r_{j}} \tag{6}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
V_{g} & :\ gravitational\ potential\\
G & :\ universal\ gravitational\ constant\\
m & :\ point\ mass\\
r & :\ distance\ between\ observation\ and\ point\ mass\\
 & :\ \sqrt{( x_{2} -x_{1})^{2} +( y_{2} -y_{1})^{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

The utilization of gravity potential is a valuable approach when encountering multiple gravity anomalies. This technique analyzes scattering point masses that are uniformly distributed across a subsurface target. However, in most geophysics exploration, mineral deposits comprise a wide range of mineral forms, which can introduce heterogeneity in the point mass principle. As a result, it is crucial to consider this variability when applying the gravity potential concept in geophysics exploration.

<h5>1.3.6) Understanding the Geoid: Gravitational Anomalies and Earth's Irregular Shape</h5>

The concept of a gravity anomaly and the geoid are both essential in understanding the Earth's gravitational field and its underlying structures. Here's a refined explanation:

A gravity anomaly is the deviation between the observed gravitational measurement at a particular location on Earth's surface and the value predicted by a theoretical model. This discrepancy arises due to the Earth's non-uniform density and topographical variations. If the Earth were a perfect oblate spheroid with uniform density, gravitational measurements would adhere to a simple algebraic expression. But with factors like altitude, nearby terrains, and the presence of dense subsurface structures, gravitational anomalies occur. These anomalies are especially revealing; for instance, a subterranean ore deposit can induce a positive anomaly because of its heightened gravitational pull.

There are various theoretical models used to predict gravity values, and the gravity anomaly is often contextualized concerning a chosen model. Examples include the Bouguer, free-air, and isostatic gravity anomalies, each factoring in distinct theoretical adjustments to gravitational values. By conducting gravity surveys with gravimeters, geologists can determine these anomalies over an area and deduce the region's subsurface geology.

While gravity anomalies delve into deviations in gravitational measurements, the geoid presents an overarching understanding of the Earth's gravitational field. The geoid represents the hypothetical shape the Earth's sea surface would assume under the sole influence of Earth's gravitational pull and rotation, excluding other factors like winds and tides. This "mathematical figure of the Earth" is an irregular, smoothed-out surface, revealing the discrepancies arising from the uneven distribution of mass both within and on Earth's surface. Although it's a conceptual surface, the geoid is a vital reference in geodesy and geophysics, offering insights into Earth's true gravitational shape and variations, determined through extensive gravitational observations and computations.

<h5>1.3.7) Geoid and the Connection to Mean Sea Level (MSL)</h5>

##### Definitions:
- **Geoid**: 
  The geoid is an equipotential surface of the Earth's gravitational field which best fits, in a least squares sense, global mean sea level. Essentially, it's the shape that the surface of the Earth's oceans would take under the influence of Earth's gravitation and rotation, ignoring other influences such as winds and tides. It is an irregular shape, undulating due to gravitational anomalies.
- **Mean Sea Level (MSL)**: 
  MSL is the average height of the sea's surface for all stages of the tide over a long period. It's used as a reference for elevations on land.
##### Connection:
- The geoid is often described as the "true zero" elevation because it represents the mean sea level without any disturbances (like waves, tides, or atmospheric pressure changes). Thus, when we speak of elevations "above sea level," we are, in essence, referring to elevations above the geoid.
- In regions where the ocean is in equilibrium (e.g., not affected by currents, tides, or other transient forces), the sea surface coincides with the geoid. However, when you move to the continents, the concept of the geoid remains crucial, because it continues to represent this "zero" elevation.
##### Complications:
- In reality, the actual sea level doesn't perfectly match the geoid everywhere. Ocean currents, prevailing winds, atmospheric pressure, and even the temperature and salinity of seawater can cause the sea level to deviate from the geoid.
- Moreover, Earth's gravity isn't uniform everywhere. There are places where gravity is a bit stronger or weaker, due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. This means the geoid isn't a perfect ellipsoid; it's bumpy and irregular.
##### Applications:
- Understanding the relationship between the geoid and MSL is crucial in various fields, from civil engineering (where it's important to know "true" elevations for construction projects) to satellite-based positioning systems like GPS.

<h3>2) Gravity Forward Modeling</h3>

Gravity observations play a vital role in geophysics by allowing for the identification of density-related anomalies and the delineation of subsurface stratigraphy within the Earth. The technique of gravity profiling is handy for interpreting these observations by dividing the Earth's subsurface into layered configurations, each with its unique geological features and density contrasts. A comprehensive understanding of the complexities of these layers is crucial, as superposition effects may complicate the accurate localization of subsurface targets.

From the above observations, it is evident that raw, unprocessed data may lead to challenges in discerning specific anomalies due to the inherent issue of superposition.

<h3>3) Gravity Correction</h3>

	Gravity anomaly. (2023, August 25). In Wikipedia. Retrieved from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gravity_anomaly&oldid=1172142178
</p>

The gravity anomaly at a location on the Earth's surface is the difference between the observed value of gravity and the value predicted by a theoretical model. If the Earth were an ideal oblate spheroid of uniform density, then the gravity measured at every point on its surface would be given precisely by a simple algebraic expression. However, the Earth has a rugged surface and non-uniform composition, which distorts its gravitational field. The theoretical value of gravity can be corrected for altitude and the effects of nearby terrain, but it usually still differs slightly from the measured value. This gravity anomaly can reveal the presence of subsurface structures of unusual density. For example, a mass of dense ore below the surface will give a positive anomaly due to the increased gravitational attraction of the ore.

Different theoretical models will predict different values of gravity, and so a gravity anomaly is always specified with reference to a particular model. The Bouguer, free-air, and isostatic gravity anomalies are each based on different theoretical corrections to the value of gravity.

A gravity survey is conducted by measuring the gravity anomaly at many locations in a region of interest, using a portable instrument called a gravimeter. Careful analysis of the gravity data allows geologists to make inferences about the subsurface geology.

<h4>3.1) The model field and corrections</h4>

<p>The starting point for the model field is the International Reference Ellipsoid, which gives the normal gravity <i>g</i><sub>n</sub> for every point on the Earth's idealized shape. Further refinements of the model field are usually expressed as corrections added to the measured gravity or (equivalently) subtracted from the normal gravity. At a minimum, these include the tidal correction △<i>g</i><sub>tid</sub>, the terrain correction △<i>g</i><sub>T</sub>, and the free air correction △<i>g</i><sub>FA</sub>. Other corrections are added for various gravitational models. The difference between the corrected measured gravity and the normal gravity is the gravity anomaly.

<h5>3.1.1) The normal gravity</h5>

The normal gravity accounts for the bulk gravitation of the entire Earth, corrected for its idealized shape and rotation. It is given by the formula:

$$
g_{n} = g_{e} \left(1 + \beta_{1} \sin^{2}\lambda + \beta_{2} \sin^{2}2\lambda \right)
$$

where:

$$
g_{e} = 9.780327 \text{ m/s}^2 \\
\beta_{1} = 5.30244 \times 10^{-3} \\
\beta_{2} = -5.8 \times 10^{-6}
$$

This is accurate to 0.1 [mgal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_(unit)) at any latitude ($\lambda $). When greater precision is needed, a more elaborate formula gives the normal gravity with an accuracy of 0.0001 mgal. $g_n$

<!-- <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> -->

<h5>3.1.2) The tidal correction</h5>

The Sun and Moon create time-dependent tidal forces that affect the measured value of gravity by about 0.3 mgal. Two-thirds of this is from the Moon. This effect is very well understood and can be calculated precisely for a given time and location using astrophysical data and formulas, to yield the tidal correction △<i>g</i><sub>tid</sub>.

<!-- <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> -->
</figure>

<h5>3.1.3) The terrain correction</h5>

The local [topography](/wiki/Topography) of the land surface affects the gravity measurement. Both terrain higher than the measurement point and valleys lower than the measurement point reduce the measured value of gravity. This is taken into account by the terrain correction △g<sub>T</sub>. The terrain correction is calculated from knowledge of the local topography and estimates of the density of the rock making up the high ground. In effect, the terrain correction levels the terrain around the measurement point. The terrain correction must be calculated for every point at which gravity is measured, taking into account every hill or valley whose difference in elevation from the measurement point is greater than about 5% of its distance from the measurement point. This is tedious and time-consuming but necessary for obtaining a meaningful gravity anomaly.

<!-- <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> -->
</figure>

<h5>3.1.4) The free-air correction</h5>

The next correction is the free-air correction. This takes into account the fact that the measurement is usually at a different elevation than the reference ellipsoid at the measurement latitude and longitude. For a measurement point above the reference ellipsoid, this means that the gravitational attraction of the bulk mass of the earth is slightly reduced. The free-air correction is simply 0.3086 mgal m<sup>−1</sup> times the elevation above the reference ellipsoid. The remaining gravity anomaly at this point in the reduction is called the *free-air anomaly*. 

$$
\Delta g_{F}=g_{m}+(\Delta g_{FA}+\Delta g_{T}+\Delta g_{\text{tide}})-g_{n}
$$

<!-- <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> -->
</figure>

<h5>3.1.5) Bouguer plate correction</h5>

The free-air anomaly does not take into account the layer of material (after terrain leveling) outside the reference ellipsoid. The gravitational attraction of this layer or plate is taken into account by the Bouguer plate correction, which is −0.0419×10<sup>−3</sup> ρ h mgal m<sup>2</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>. The density of crustal rock, ρ, is usually taken to be 2670 kg m<sup>3</sup> so the Bouguer plate correction is usually taken as −0.1119 mgal m<sup>−1</sup> h. Here h is the elevation above the reference ellipsoid. The remaining gravity anomaly at this point in the reduction is called the *Bouguer anomaly*. That is, the Bouguer anomaly is: 

$$
\Delta g_{B}=g_{m}+(\Delta g_{BP}+\Delta g_{FA}+\Delta g_{T}+\Delta g_{\text{tide}})-g_{n}
