<h4>1.1) The Law of Universal Gravitation</h4>
<p>
Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was born in the same year
in which Galileo died. Unlike Galileo, who relished
debate, Newton was a retiring person and avoided con-
frontation. His modesty is apparent in a letter written in
1675 to his colleague Robert Hooke, famous for his exper-
iments on elasticity. In this letter Newton made the
famous disclaimer “if I have seen further (than you and
Descartes) it is by standing upon the shoulders of
Giants.” In modern terms Newton would be regarded as a
theoretical physicist. He had an outstanding ability to
synthesize experimental results and incorporate them
into his own theories. Faced with the need for a more
powerful technique of mathematical analysis than existed
at the time, he invented diﬀerential and integral calculus,
for which he is credited equally with Gottfried Wilhelm
von Leibnitz (1646–1716) who discovered the same
method independently. Newton was able to resolve many
issues by formulating logical thought experiments; an
example is his prediction that the shape of the Earth is an
oblate ellipsoid. He was one of the most outstanding syn-
thesizers of observations in scientific history, which is
implicit in his letter to Hooke. His three-volume book
Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published
in 1687, ranks as the greatest of all scientific texts. The
first volume of the Principia contains Newton’s famous
Laws of Motion, the third volume handles the Law of
Universal Gravitation.

The first two laws of motion are generalizations from
Galileo’s results. As a corollary Newton applied his laws
of motion to demonstrate that forces must be added as
vectors and showed how to do this geometrically with a
parallelogram. The second law of motion states that the
rate of change of momentum of a mass is proportional
to the force acting upon it and takes place in the direction
of the force. For the case of constant mass, this law serves
as the definition of force $\mathbf{F}$ in terms of the acceleration
$\mathbf{a}$ given to a mass $m$:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{green}\mathbf{F}} = m{\color{green}\mathbf{a}} \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq1"></div>

The unit of force in the SI system of units is the
newton $(N)$. It is defined as the force that gives a mass of
one kilogram $(1\ kg)$ an acceleration of $1\ ms^2$.
His celebrated observation of a falling apple may be a
legend, but Newton’s genius lay in recognizing that the
type of gravitational field that caused the apple to fall was
the same type that served to hold the Moon in its orbit
around the Earth, the planets in their orbits around the
Sun, and that acted between minute particles characterized
only by their masses. If consider the Earth and falling apple as two particles, or point
masses $m$ and $M$ separated by a distance $r$, we
get for the gravitational attraction $F$ exerted by $M$ on $m$

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{green}\mathbf{F}} =G\times \frac{mM}{r^{2}} \times {\color{green}\mathbf{\hat{r}}} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq2"></div>

In this equation $r̂$ is a unit vector in the direction of
increase in coordinate $r$, which is directed away from the
center of reference at the mass $M$. The negative sign in the
equation indicates that the force $F$ acts in the opposite
direction, toward the attracting mass $M$. The constant $G$,
which converts the physical law to an equation, is the constant of universal gravitation.

There was no way to determine the gravitational constant experimentally during Newton’s lifetime. The
method to be followed was evident, namely to determine
the force between two masses in a laboratory experiment.
However, seventeenth century technology was not yet up
to this task. Experimental determination of $G$ was
extremely diﬃcult, and was first achieved more than a
century after the publication of Principia by Lord
Charles Cavendish (1731–1810). From a set of painstaking measurements of the force of attraction between two spheres of lead, Cavendish in 1798 determined the value
of $G$ to be $6.754\times 10^{11} \ m^{3} \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}$. A modern value
(Mohr and Taylor, 2005) is $6.674\ 210\ \times 10^{11} \ m^{3} \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}$.
It has not yet been possible to determine G more precisely,
due to experimental diﬃculty. Although other physical
constants are now known with a relative standard uncer-
tainty of much less than $1 \times 10^6$, the gravitational constant is known to only $150 \times 10^6$.

<h5>1.1.1) Utilizing Newton's Universal Gravitation Law in Geophysics: Assumptions and Applications</h5>
<p>
To harness the power of Newton's universal law, (<a href="#eq2">Equation 2</a>), of gravitation in geophysical investigations, we must establish certain fundamental assumptions. Primarily, we must consider the observation point and the object of interest (the target) as discrete point masses. This reduction allows us to bypass the complexities of multipoint mass attractions. Moreover, we must regard the Earth's strata as possessing a significantly lower mass than the target. This simplification allows us to approach the geophysical challenges with less computational complexity, enabling the application of point mass approximations in our calculations, as depicted in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. Note that these assumptions are still impractical for building a gravitational device.

<h4>1.2) Gravitational Acceleration</h4>
<p>
In physics the field of a force is often more important than the absolute magnitude of the force. The field is defined as the force exerted on a material unit. For example, the electrical field of a charged body at a certain position is the force it exerts on a unit of electrical charge at that location. The gravitational field in the vicinity of an attracting mass is the force it exerts on a unit mass. <a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a> shows that this is equivalent to the acceleration vector.
    
In geophysical applications we are concerned with accelerations rather than forces. By comparing Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) we get the gravitational acceleration $g$ of the mass $m$ due to the attraction of the mass $M$:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\color{green}\mathbf{g}} =-G\times \frac{M}{r^{2}} \times {\color{green}\mathbf{\hat{r}}} \tag{3}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq3"></div>

The SI unit of acceleration is the $m \cdot s^{-2}$; this unit is
unpractical for use in geophysics. In the now superseded
c.g.s. system the unit of acceleration was the $cm \cdot s^{-2}$,
which is called a gal in recognition of the contributions of
Galileo. The small changes in the acceleration of gravity
caused by geological structures are measured in thousandths of this unit, i.e., in milligal (mgal). Until recently, gravity anomalies due to geological structures were surveyed with field instruments accurate to about one-tenth of a milligal, which was called a gravity unit. Modern
instruments are capable of measuring gravity diﬀerences
to a millionth of a gal, or microgal (mgal), which is
becoming the practical unit of gravity investigations. The
value of gravity at the Earth’s surface is about $9.8 \ m \cdot s^{-2}$,
and so the sensitivity of modern measurements of gravity
is about $1$ part in $109$.
</p>

<h5>1.2.1) Gravimeter: Absolute Gravity</h5>
<p>
In the design of gravimeters, practical measurements typically hinge on the acceleration of the free-fall object rather than directly on force. This practical approach employs <a href="#eq3">Equation 3</a>, enabling the computation of gravitational acceleration. Essentially, this translates into assessing variations in gravity from a predetermined reference level.

For application in exploration geophysics, Eq. (3) needs to be simplified. The gravity term $g$ is substituted with $\delta g$ because of the tiny changes in gravity accerlation caused by the Earth's strata. Newton's original conception of planetary orbits in gravity attraction is significantly larger if compared with the internal Earth's crusts, so the gravity unit is implemented here. The negative sign in $-G$ is typically disregarded because most scenarios in exploration geophysics occur within the subsurface and the absolute direction of gravity points toward the Earth's cores. In a number of measurements, the unit vector $\mathbf{\hat{r}}$ can be assumed to be $1$ to avoid computation complexity. The target $M$ can be replaced with $\Delta M$, indicating that the density contrasts between the rock and its host is large enough to produce a distinguishable "anomaly." Thus, the Eq. (3) reformulates to <a href="#eq4">Equation 4</a> and $\Delta M$ can relate to $\delta \rho \times v$. 

$$
\begin{align*}
\delta g=G\times \frac{\Delta M}{r^{2}} =\frac{G}{r^{2}} \times \delta \rho \times v \tag{4}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq4"></div>

$$
\begin{align*}
\delta g\  & =gravity\ attraction\ between\ weight\ drop\ and\ rocks\\
G\  & =universal\ gravitational\ constant\ \left( 6.674\times 10^{-11} ,\ m^{3} \cdot kg^{-1} \cdot s^{-2}\right)\\
\Delta M\  & =mass\ contrast\ between\ rock\ and\ its\ host\\
r\  & =distance\ between\ the\ rock\ and\ weight\ drop\\
\delta \rho \  & =density\ contrast\\
v\  & =volume\ of\ the\ rock

        While direct measurement of force attraction can be used to detect subsurface anomalies, it often presents challenges in terms of device creation. Consequently, measuring changes in weight attributable to gravitational acceleration can be a more practical method. This approach simplifies the design and construction of a gravimeter, a device used for these measurements.

NewG Company is engaged in exploration geophysics, currently working on a project aimed at locating subterranean gold deposits. They utilize a gravimeter to construct a gravity profile that assists in identifying gravity anomalies. Refer to <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> for a depiction of the acquisition layout, where the first station registers a gravity acceleration represented as $f(x, y, r)$. In this function, $f$ corresponds to the coordinates $x$ and $y$, and the distance $r$ from the gravity station to the target. Using the given data in the following table, calculate the gravity profile associated with the prospective subsurface gold deposit.
