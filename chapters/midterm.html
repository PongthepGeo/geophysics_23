<h2>
    Midterm Exam: Gravity Exploration Design for Gold Deposit Locating
</h2>

## Background:

**Frontier Explorers**, a geophysics company, is cooperating with **PTTEP** to pinpoint a prospective gold deposit in an intricate geological setting, which is characterized by igneous rock assemblages. The terrain under investigation showcases a prominent magmatic episode where a series of plutonic dikes have penetrated the pre-existing primary host rock. There are two noteworthy rock types in the area:

- **Dike Rock (Mafic Dike)**: These linear, discordant intrusive bodies, potentially of basaltic or gabbroic composition, were emplaced into the fractures of the host rock during periods of tectonic stress.
  
- **Host Rock (Felsic Intrusive)**: This is the primary rock into which the dikes intrude. It's an igneous rock, likely of granitic or dioritic composition, and is rich in quartz. At several locations, this rock surfaces, forming outcrops that offer invaluable insights into the subsurface geology.

The proximity and interplay of these rock types, combined with the inherent geochemical processes, suggest a conducive environment for gold mineralization. This environment could be attributed to processes like magmatic differentiation or hydrothermal alterations linked to the region's magmatic activities.

## Tasks:

### Modeling:
The given figure represents a gold deposit within plutonic dikes. Analyze and comment on the challenges associated with determining the depth and size of the gold deposit.

        </strong>
        Given a provided figure, interpret a potential subsurface location for a gold deposit. Note that the exact size of the deposit remains undetermined and the figure is not to scale. Utilizing the information from the background section, construct a suitable density model to aid in your interpretation.

### Gravity Profiling:
Develop a set of gravity profiles based on the given figure. Elucidate your methodology and rationale behind creating these profiles.

### Gravity Data Corrections:
Detail the gravity corrections you would apply to refine the data. Illustrate the enhancements made, emphasizing the clarity or intensity of any potential gold-related anomaly.

### Depth and Size Estimation:
Propose a technique or method that would effectively estimate the depth and size of the gold deposit. Justify your choice of method and describe its application in this context.

## Discussion:

Based on the tasks completed, compile your findings and interpretations into a presentation slide. Present your work, ensuring to highlight key methodologies, results, and implications.
