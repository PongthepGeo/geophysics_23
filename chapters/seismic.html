seismic survey, method of investigating subterranean structure, particularly as related to exploration for petroleum, natural gas, and mineral deposits. The technique is based on determining the time interval that elapses between the initiation of a seismic wave at a selected shot point (the location where an explosion generates seismic waves) and the arrival of reflected or refracted impulses at one or more seismic detectors. Seismic air guns are commonly used to initiate the seismic waves. This technique has largely replaced the practice of exploding dynamite underground. Electric vibrators or falling weights (thumpers) may also be employed at sites where an underground explosion might cause damage—e.g., where caverns are present. Upon arrival at the detectors, the amplitude and timing of waves are recorded to give a seismogram (record of ground vibrations).

Generally, the density of rocks near the surface of Earth increases with depth. Seismic waves initiated at a shot point at or near the surface may reach the receiving point by reflection, refraction, or both. When the shot point is close to the receiving point, reflected waves usually reach the receiving point first. At greater distances, however, the seismic pulse travels faster by the refraction path because its velocity is greater along the top of the lower, denser layer than it is through the upper layer; in this case, the refracted wave arrives first.

Interpretation of the depths and media reached by seismic waves thus depends on the distance between shot points and receiving points and the densities of the strata. The results of a seismic survey may be presented in the form of a cross-sectional drawing of the subsurface structures as if cut by a plane through the shot point, the detector, and Earth’s centre. Such drawings are called seismic profiles.

    The Vibroseis, a seismic source, generates energy by vibrating a heavy metal weight at a targeted frequency range, aiming to transmit substantial energy into the Earth's subsurface. As this energy propagates through various geological layers, it encounters different materials and interfaces, causing reflections of the energy back to the surface. Geophones, positioned on the surface, record these reflections. Subsequent analysis of the data produces an image of the subsurface, revealing a geological image. This method offers a non-invasive technique to explore and understand the geological structures beneath the Earth's surface.

<h4>1.1) Understanding Seismic Image</h4>

When comparing seismic images with photographic images, it's essential to note the significant disparities in resolution. The resolution effectively describes an image's detail and is often considerably higher in photographic images than seismic images. 

Photographic imagery is dependent on the interaction of light waves with objects. This interaction occurs when light waves from a source, such as the Sun, propagate to the objects and reflect back to the camera sensor, where they are recorded. Because the waves travel through the air, they experience minimal attenuation and maintain their high frequencies, resulting in high-resolution images.

Seismic images inherently possess lower resolution due to the nature of the seismic waves and the medium they travel through, compared to photographic images. The seismic waves used for imaging typically fall within a lower frequency range, such as 5-80 Hz for vibroseis and 10-300 Hz for airguns used in marine exploration. These mechanical waves propagate through the Earth's strata, which are characterized by high-attenuation properties that result from the complex and heterogeneous nature of geological formations. This medium, consisting of rocks and various substrates, tends to absorb and scatter the seismic energy, thereby reducing the quality and resolution of the returned signal that is eventually used for imaging the subsurface structures. On the other hand, photographic images are formed by electromagnetic waves traveling through a low attenuation medium, such as air, resulting in higher resolution.

    In the field of subsurface exploration, it is observed that waves attenuate considerably as they propagate through different materials of the Earth. This attenuation is more pronounced than in waves travelling through air, leading to a loss of energy and detail. Consequently, seismic images show lower resolution. To demonstrate this difference, we can compare a high-resolution photometric image (depicted in green) to a low-resolution seismic image (in cyan). The high-resolution image has a more intricate "zigzag" pattern in the trace, which suggests that it retains more detail.

<h4>1.2) Understanding Seismic Trace</h4>

To delve into the concept of seismic resolution, it is pivotal to first comprehend the principles of simple harmonic motion. Once a foundational understanding of measuring simple harmonic forms is established, we can enhance our knowledge by examining the Fourier Transform, enabling a richer comprehension of how stacking multiple harmonic forms contributes to a clearer and more precise resolution in seismic data analysis.

<h5>1.2.1) Simple Harmonic</h5>

Let's start by exploring the simple harmonic forms of sine and cosine functions. These functions oscillate in nearly identical patterns, but they have a distinct phase difference, which can be described in terms of radians or degrees. Understanding these units of measurement is essential when considering the phase shift between these two functions.

<h5>1.2.2) Measuring Seismic Frequency</h5>

To gain a comprehensive understanding of seismic quality, it is beneficial to incorporate the known characteristics of harmonic waveforms. This approach allows us to approximate seismic frequency and construct the seismic trace. When waveforms are superimposed, their amplitude is enhanced, while an out-of-phase arrangement results in a decrease in amplitude. This comprehension is fundamental to the principle of Fourier Transform and can offer valuable insights for the analysis of seismic data.

<h5>1.2.3) Fourier Series</h5>

The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a mathematical technique used in signal processing and many other fields to analyze the frequency content of a discrete signal. It's fundamentally a transformation used to convert a signal from its time or spatial domain into its frequency domain. The DFT converts a sequence of complex numbers $x_n$ into another sequence of complex numbers $x_k$. 

In the context of the equation you've provided:

$$$
f(t) = \frac{a_{0}}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left[ a_{n} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}\right) + b_{n} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi nt}{P}\right)\right] \tag{2}
$$$


This equation represents a Fourier series, which is a way to represent a periodic function as a sum of sine and cosine functions. The Fourier series is particularly useful for analyzing functions that are periodic over a certain interval.

Contrasting with DFT:

The DFT is defined by the formula:

$$$
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \cdot e^{-i2\pi kn/N} \tag{3}
$$$

where:
- $X_k$ are the DFT coefficients (output of the DFT),
- $x_n$ are the input sequence values,
- $N$ is the total number of samples,
- $k$ is the index of the DFT output, and
- $i$ is the imaginary unit.

This transformation is used when the function \(f(t)\) is sampled at discrete points in time (or space) and is assumed to be periodic for the purpose of the analysis.

Key Points about DFT:

1. **Discrete and Finite**: DFT deals with discrete signals which are finite.

2. **Periodicity**: Assumes that the input signal is periodic and continues indefinitely.

3. **Complex Exponential**: Uses complex exponentials as the basis functions.

4. **Complex Output**: The DFT produces a sequence of complex numbers, which represent the amplitude and phase of sinusoids at different frequencies.

5. **Computational Efficiency**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm is often used to compute the DFT efficiently.

6. **Frequency Resolution**: The frequency resolution of the DFT is determined by the length of the input signal. More points yield better frequency resolution.

7. **Amplitude and Phase Information**: Provides both amplitude and phase information for each frequency component in the signal.

Applications:

- **Signal Analysis**: To analyze the frequency content of signals.
  
- **Data Compression**: For example, in image compression, like in the JPEG format.

- **Signal Filtering**: To design filters in the frequency domain, which are then applied to signals in the time domain.

- **Spectral Analysis**: To examine the power spectrum of signals.

- **Telecommunications**: For modulation and demodulation in communication systems.

- **Image Processing**: For filtering and reconstructing images.

The DFT is fundamental to many digital signal processing applications. It enables the representation of a signal in terms of its frequency content, facilitating numerous operations like filtering, compression, and analysis.

The main seismic wave types are Compressional (P), Shear (S), Rayleigh (R), and Love (L) waves.  P and S waves are often called body waves because they propagate outward in all directions from a source (such as an earthquake) and travel through the interior of the Earth.  In the animations shown here, the P (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>) and S (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>) waves are shown propagating horizontally, parallel to the Earth's surface.  Love and Rayleigh waves are surface waves and propagate approximately parallel to the Earth’s surface.  Although surface wave motion penetrates to significant depth in the Earth, these four types of waves do not propagate directly through the Earth’s interior.  Descriptions of wave characteristics and particle motions for the four-wave types are given in the Table below. 

| Wave Type (and names) | Particle Motion | Typical Velocity | Other Characteristics |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| P, Compressional, Primary, Longitudinal | Alternating compressions (“pushes”) and dilations (“pulls”) which are directed in the same direction as the wave is propagating (along the ray path); and therefore, perpendicular to the wavefront. | VP ~ 5 – 7 km/s in typical Earth’s crust; >~ 8 km/s in Earth’s mantle and core; ~1.5 km/s in water; ~0.3 km/s in air. | P motion travels fastest in materials, so the P-wave is the first-arriving energy on a seismogram. Generally smaller and higher frequency than the S and Surface-waves. P waves in a liquid or gas are pressure waves, including sound waves. |
| S, Shear, Secondary, Transverse | Alternating transverse motions (perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and the ray path); commonly approximately polarized such that particle motion is in vertical or horizontal planes. | VS ~ 3 – 4 km/s in typical Earth’s crust; >~ 4.5 km/s in Earth’s mantle; ~ 2.5-3.0 km/s in (solid) inner core. | S-waves do not travel through fluids, so do not exist in Earth’s outer core (inferred to be primarily liquid iron) or in air or water or molten rock (magma). S waves travel slower than P waves in a solid and, therefore, arrive after the P wave. |
| L, Love, Surface waves, Long waves | Transverse horizontal motion, perpendicular to the direction of propagation and generally parallel to the Earth’s surface. | VL ~ 2.0 - 4.4 km/s in the Earth depending on frequency of the propagating wave, and therefore the depth of penetration of the waves. | Love waves exist because of the Earth’s surface. They are largest at the surface and decrease in amplitude with depth. Love waves are dispersive, that is, the wave velocity is dependent on frequency, generally with low frequencies propagating at higher velocity. Depth of penetration of the Love waves is also dependent on frequency, with lower frequencies penetrating to greater depth. |
| R, Rayleigh, Surface waves, Long waves, Ground roll | Motion is both in the direction of propagation and perpendicular (in a vertical plane), and “phased” so that the motion is generally elliptical – either prograde or retrograde. | VR ~ 2.0 - 4.2 km/s in the Earth depending on frequency of the propagating wave, and therefore the depth of penetration of the waves. | Rayleigh waves are also dispersive and the amplitudes generally decrease with depth in the Earth. Appearance and particle motion are similar to water waves. Depth of penetration of the Rayleigh waves is also dependent on frequency, with lower frequencies penetrating to greater depth. |


<h4>2.1) Seismic Wave Characteristics</h4>

<h5>2.1.1) P-waves</h5>

In the <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> illustrating P-wave propagation, the transmitted energy moves through the medium, causing particles to undergo compressional and dilational motions. The energy direction is parallel to the particle motion axis. As the wave passes, particles are first compressed (squeezed), and then released, leading to dilation. It's important to note that while the rock medium may momentarily alter its features during this process, it eventually returns to its original shape due to its elastic nature.

    P-waves travel primarily along one axis, causing particles in their path to oscillate with alternating compression and dilation. This is often referred to as particle vibration.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>2.1.2) S-waves</h5>

S-waves propagate linearly along a distinct axis, but the induced particle displacements occur perpendicular to this propagation direction. These orthogonal oscillations manifest as vertical (SV) and horizontal (SH) motions relative to the wave's trajectory. Notably, Eath's materials such as gases and liquids lack the rigidity to support these shear motions, thereby inhibiting the transmission of S-waves through them.

<h3>3) Acoustic Wave Phenomena</h3>

Primary (P-waves) are synonymous with acoustic waves, sound waves, and compressional waves, which can express as one-dimensional wave equation depicted as <a href="#eq4">Equation 4</a>. This equation describes how wave disturbances propagate through a medium over time. In this equation:

$$$
\frac{\partial ^{2} y}{\partial t^{2}} =c^{2} \cdot \frac{\partial ^{2} y}{\partial x^{2}} \tag{4}
$$$
<div id="eq4"></div>

- $y$ is the displacement of the medium at position $x$ and time $t$.
- $c$ represents the wave speed in the medium. This parameter can emprically from laburatory shown as the table below.
- The term $(\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2})$ describes the acceleration of the wave disturbance with respect to time. This term can be thought of as how quickly the displacement of the medium changes over time.
- The term $(c^2 \cdot \frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2})$ describes the curvature of the wave disturbance in space, which gives an idea of how the wave shape changes over a small distance. The wave speed $c$ scales this spatial curvature to determine its effect on the temporal acceleration of the disturbance.

The finite difference method is a widely recognized approach for addressing <a href="#eq4">Equation 4</a>. However, an in-depth discussion on solving and proving such equations falls outside the purview of this discussion. <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> showcases the progression of 2D acoustic wave propagation originating from a point source. As time advances, the wavefront expands, moving further from the point of origin.

<h4>3.1) Wave Phenomena: Reflection</h4>

The provided illustration depicts the symmetrical propagation of P-waves (Primary or Pressure waves) as they spread through a homogeneous medium, originating from a central point. If these waves encounter a boundary, they can reflect back towards the surface. This phenomenon is appropriately termed "reflection." The uniformity of the medium ensures that the waves move consistently in all directions, and any deviations from this symmetrical pattern can indicate variations or anomalies within the medium.

Time steps 140 and 160 ms demonstrate the wave propagations in upward (reflected wave) and downward (transmitted wave) directions. 
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>3.2) Wave Phenomena: Interbed Multiple</h4>

Multiple generally refers to the wave phenomenon that reflects more than one time. Our scenario shows that the reflected waves at time step 200 ms reflect at the first layer and propagate downward to the second layer. The wave can oscillate in the sandstone layer more than one time. Conventional seismic processing considers multiple as noise; duplicating the first layer (in this scenario) caused an artifact of the fake layer.

In wave physics, the term "multiples" describes a phenomenon where seismic waves undergo several reflections before being recorded. This process can occur when a wave reflects off an interface more than once, creating an oscillatory path within the layers of the subsurface.

In the scenario presented, the snapshots taken at time step 200 ms reveal the occurrence of multiples. The seismic waves, initially reflected from the first lithological layer, travel downward and subsequently interact with the interface between the first and second layers. Following this interaction, the waves are reflected into the sandstone layer, potentially undergoing additional reflections. As a result, these waves can oscillate multiple times within the sandstone stratum before ultimately being recorded or dissipating.

Conventional seismic processing often categorizes multiples as noise, given that they can obscure or distort the true subsurface image. In this context, the multiple reflections within the sandstone layer can create an artifact that mimics the presence of an additional, non-existent layer. This pseudo-layer is a byproduct of the repeated reflections and can lead to misinterpretations in seismic data analysis.

Hence, understanding and accurately identifying multiples is crucial in seismic processing to ensure the fidelity of subsurface imaging and to prevent the introduction of artifacts that can compromise the integrity of geological interpretations.

The Huygens–Fresnel principle (named after Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens and French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel) states that every point on a wavefront is itself the source of spherical wavelets, and the secondary wavelets emanating from different points mutually interfere. The sum of these spherical wavelets forms a new wavefront. As such, the Huygens-Fresnel principle is a method of analysis applied to problems of luminous wave propagation both in the far-field limit and in near-field diffraction as well as reflection.
