<h1>Recap Python</h1>

<h2>1. Math Operators</h2>
<p>In Python, we use math operators to perform arithmetic. Here are some common operators:</p>
<ul>
  <li>+: Addition</li>
  <li>-: Subtraction</li>
  <li>*: Multiplication</li>
  <li>/: Division</li>
  <li>**: Exponentiation</li>
  <li>%: Modulus (remainder)</li>
  <li>//: Integer division</li>
</ul>

```python
# Example usage:
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # Output: 13
print(a - b)  # Output: 7
print(a * b)  # Output: 30
print(a / b)  # Output: 3.3333333333333335
print(a ** b) # Output: 1000
print(a % b)  # Output: 1
print(a // b) # Output: 3
```

<h2>2. If-Else Statement</h2>
<p>In Python, we use 'if', 'elif', and 'else' keywords to control the flow of the program based on conditions.</p>

**Operators:**

1. **`==` (Equal):** This operator checks if the values of two operands are equal. If they are, the condition becomes true.
2. **`!=` (Not equal):** This operator checks if the values of two operands are not equal. If they are not equal, the condition becomes true.
3. **`>` (Greater than):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true.
4. **`<` (Less than):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true.
5. **`>=` (Greater than or equal to):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true.
6. **`<=` (Less than or equal to):** This operator checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand. If it is, the condition becomes true.

```python
# Example usage:
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")  # This will be printed
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")
# Additional comparison operators:

# == : Checks if the values of two operands are equal
# != : Checks if the values of two operands are not equal
# >  : Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand
# <  : Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand
# >= : Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand
# <= : Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand
```

<p>Use the if-else statement to create a rule to process an input grade for 100 students. The function should follow this grading scale:

<ul>
  <li>A: 90-100</li>
  <li>B: 80-89</li>
  <li>C: 70-79</li>
  <li>D: 60-69</li>
  <li>F: <60</li>
</ul>

    print('your letter grade is B')
elif score >= 65 and score < 70:
    print('your letter grade is C+')

**Description:**

This Python script consists of three main parts which are separated by comment lines. 

1. In the first part, it creates a list of random scores for a simulated class of 100 students. 
2. It then prints the scores of the first 10 students to give you a glimpse of the data. 
3. Lastly, it uses an if-else statement to assign a letter grade to the first student's score based on common grading standards.

Let's break it down step by step:

- `number_of_student = 100`: This line sets the number of students as 100.
- `list_score = [random.randint(0, number_of_student) for _ in range(number_of_student)]`: This is a list comprehension, a compact way of creating a list in Python. This specific line creates a list of 100 random integers between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Each integer represents a student's score.
- `print(f"the first 10 student grades: {list_score[0:10]}")`: This line prints the scores of the first 10 students. In Python, indices start from 0, so `list_score[0:10]` gets the scores of the first 10 students.
- `score = list_score[0]`: This line assigns the first student's score to the variable `score`.
- The last part of the script is a multi-branch if-else statement. It checks the value of `score` and prints a corresponding letter grade. For example, if the score is between 80 and 100, it prints 'A'. If it's between 75 and 80, it prints 'B+', and so on. If the score is below 55, it prints 'F'.

<h2>3. Built-in Functions</h2>

Some of the most common mathematical functions in NumPy:

1. **`numpy.abs(x)`**: This function operates element-wise to calculate the absolute value. It works on arrays, unlike the built-in Python function `abs()`.

```python
import numpy as np
print(np.abs([-1, -2, 3]))  # Output: array([1, 2, 3])
```

2. **`numpy.round(a, decimals)`**: This function rounds an array to the given number of decimals.

```python
print(np.round([0.37, 1.64]))  # Output: array([0., 2.])
```

3. **`numpy.amin(a)`** and **`numpy.amax(a)`**: These functions return the minimum and maximum of an array along an axis, respectively.

```python
print(np.amin([4, 2, 9]))  # Output: 2
print(np.amax([4, 2, 9]))  # Output: 9
```

4. **`numpy.sum(a, axis)`**: This function returns the sum of array elements over a given axis.

```python
print(np.sum([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
```

5. **`numpy.mean(a, axis)`**: This function computes the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.

```python
print(np.mean([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
```

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
start = 0
increasing_interval = 2*np.pi
number_of_datapoints = 1000
x = np.linspace(start, increasing_interval, number_of_datapoints)
sin_ = np.sin(x)
cos_ = np.cos(x)
sum_ = sin_ + cos_
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))  
plt.plot(x, sin_, label='sin(x)', color='blue')  
plt.plot(x, cos_, label='cos(x)', color='red')  
plt.plot(x, sum_, label='sin(x)+cos(x)', linewidth=5, color='green')

**Description:**

The code now plots **`sin(x), cos(x),`** and their sum in different colors (blue, red, and green, respectively) on the same graph. The label parameter is used to set the names that will appear in the legend. **`plt.legend()`** is used to display the legend.

The plot will help you visualize how the functions **`sin(x), cos(x),`** and their sum behave over one period. The x-axis represents the input value (**`from 0 to 2Ï€`**) and the y-axis represents the output of the functions. Each function is represented by a different color, as specified in the plot command. The legend on the plot helps you identify which color corresponds to which function.

<h2>4. User Defined Functions</h2>

Some of the most common mathematical functions in NumPy:

1. **`numpy.abs(x)`**: This function operates element-wise to calculate the absolute value. It works on arrays, unlike the built-in Python function `abs()`.
