<p>
The Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) technique is a widely recognized and reliable method for geological investigations. This method involves the injection of current into the ground through electrodes, followed by the measurement of the ensuing potential and calculating the resistance and resistivity. The fundamental principle of ERT is that resistivity values have the potential to identify subsurface features or geological structures.

Variations in electrical resistivity typically correlate with variations in soil and rock conditions, such as lithology changes, water saturation, fluid conductivity, porosity, and permeability, which can be used for constructing map stratigraphic units, geological structures, sinkholes, fractures, and groundwater.

The ERT method is often used in conjunction with other reconnaissance geophysical methods, such as electromagnetic mapping or ground penetrating radar (GPR), to help further constrain any anomalous areas. It also complements other profile mapping techniques, such as seismic refraction and MASW.

<h4>1.1) Applications of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT)</h4>

<p>
The main applications of ERT are in engineering and environmental geophysics, although the method is also used in hydrogeology, archaeology, mineral exploration, and crime scene investigation. Typical applications for resistivity data include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Identifying areas of potential instability or slope failure</li>
    <li>Mapping the depth to bedrock</li>
    <li>Delineating aquifers and aquitards</li>
    <li>Detecting leaks from landfill sites and hazardous waste disposal sites</li>
    <li>Mapping the extent of contamination plumes in soil and groundwater</li>
    <li>Locating buried channels, dikes, or other structures that may impede groundwater flow</li>
    <li>Locating areas of potential sinkhole collapse</li>
    <li>Studying the effects of dewatering or other fluid injection/extraction processes on subsurface fractures</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.2) Comparing ERT with Other Geophysical Surveys</h4>

<p>
There are many benefits to using ERT over other geophysical methods, including: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Non-invasive</b> - ERT is a non-destructive method that has significant low foot print on the environment.</li>
    <li><b>Repeatable</b> - Resistivity measurements can be made at any time and under any conditions, making it ideal for long-term monitoring applications.</li>
    <li><b>Versatile</b> - ERT can be used in a wide range of different environments, from deep mines to shallow wetlands.</li>
    <li><b>Flexible</b> - ERT surveys can be tailored to meet the specific needs of the project. For example, the electrode spacing and array configuration can be varied to achieve the desired depth of investigation and resolution.</li>
    <li><b>Cost-effective</b> - ERT is a relatively low-cost geophysical method, especially when compared to other invasive methods.</li>
</ul>

<h4>1.3) Electrical Resistivity Imaging: Principles, Interpretation, and Geological Insights</h4>

<p>
Resistivity imaging involves measuring a series of readings along a profile with the electrodes at a set spacing. The resistivity data can be collected using a variety of electrode array configurations, the choice being selected by the geophysicist on-site to meet the objectives of the survey.

Electrical resistivity imaging provides a complete data set from very close to the surface to a considerable depth. The depth of investigation and the resolution achieved are dependent on the electrode spacing and electrode configuration used. Longer spreads will achieve a greater depth but trading resolution.

The apparent resistivity values are affected by a number of factors and it is important, therefore, that the geophysicist considers all relevant information when interpreting resistivity data. Different materials have different resistivity values, which means that the interpretation of ERT profiles requires an understanding of the geology and hydrogeology in the area under investigation.

High resistivity values indicate a low conductivity and are usually associated with materials such as air, sand, or gravel. A low resistivity value indicates a high conductivity and is generally associated with materials such as clay or water.

<h3>2) Direct Current (DC) Resistivity</h3>

<h4>2.1) Gravity Field vs. Electric Field</h4> 

Both gravity and electric fields exert forces that influence matter. The strengths of these fields can be evaluated by introducing relevant matter which reacts to these forces. In the context of a gravitational field, presenting a point mass allows the observation of a force pulling it towards the larger mass. This force's intensity is directly proportional to the strength of the gravitational field, thereby providing a method to gauge it.

Conversely, an electric field exhibits similar behavior when a charge is introduced. The reaction of the test charge is contingent on its nature and the source's nature. If the source and test charges are positive, they repel each other due to the like-charges repulsion principle. However, if the charges are opposite - one positive and the other negative - they attract each other, demonstrating the principle of opposite charges attraction.

Thus, the interaction of a test mass or charge within a gravity or electric field, respectively, offers an effective method to measure the strength of these fields. The observed attractive or repulsive forces provide essential information on the fields' characteristics and strengths.

        This figure illustrates the behavior of test particles within gravitational and electric fields. A point mass is drawn towards a larger mass in a gravitational field, whereas a test charge either attracts or repels another charge based on their polarities in an electric field. These interactions shed light on the underlying strengths and characteristics of the respective fields.

<h4>2.2) Electrical Dipole</h4> 

1. Electric Field Lines:

   Electric field lines give us a pictorial representation of the electric field produced by the dipole. They originate from the positive charge and terminate at the negative charge. They represent the direction of the electric field, which is the direction that a positive test charge would move if placed in the field.

   In the vicinity of the charges, the field lines are approximately radial, similar to the field lines of isolated charges. But at larger distances, the field lines start to curve and point from the positive to the negative charge.

   Field lines in the middle of the dipole, between the two charges, are straight and point directly from the positive to the negative charge.

2. Equipotential Surfaces:

   Equipotential surfaces are surfaces where the electric potential is the same at all points. This means that no work is done by the electric field in moving a test charge along an equipotential surface.

   For an electric dipole, these surfaces take the form of a series of nested, distorted spheres or ellipsoids. Right at the midpoint between the two charges, the equipotential surface is a plane perpendicular to the line joining the charges.

   On this plane, the potential is zero (if we consider the potential at infinity as zero). As we move towards the positive charge, the potential increases, and the equipotential surfaces become increasingly positively distorted spheres. As we move towards the negative charge, the potential decreases, and the equipotential surfaces become increasingly negatively distorted spheres.

   Remember that the electric field lines are always perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces, which is why no work is done moving along an equipotential surface.

<h4>2.3) Lightning: Multiple Electrical Poles</h4> 

Electric multipoles are an extension of the concept of charge. A simple charged particle is a monopole. When two charges of equal magnitude and opposite sign are brought close together, they form an electric dipole. More complex arrangements of charges give rise to higher multipoles, like quadrupoles, octupoles, etc.

A lightning strike represents a strong electric dipole moment in nature, albeit on a much larger scale than usually considered in physics problems. The dipole is formed by the separation of charge between the ground (generally negatively charged) and the cloud (generally positively charged). This charge separation generates an intense electric field. When the electric field strength becomes too great, the air becomes ionized (forming a plasma), creating a path of least resistance for the charges to equalize. This equalization process is the lightning bolt, an energetic discharge following the path of the plasma channel.

In more complex storm systems, there can be various regions of differing charge, leading to a situation more akin to a multipole rather than a simple dipole, with multiple lightning strikes following different paths to equalize the various regions of charge. However, it's worth noting that these systems are far more complicated and chaotic than the idealized static charge distributions usually considered when studying multipoles in physics.

        Lightning can be thought of as a dramatic and large-scale demonstration of electric fields and their associated forces. In many ways, lightning can be conceptually related to the more abstract concept of electric multipoles, such as dipoles, quadrupoles, and so on.

In conclusion, while lightning and electric multipoles are different in terms of scale and complexity, both stem from the principles of electric charge and electric fields, making them conceptually related.

Geophysical instruments have been developed to measure the electrical properties of the subsurface over multiple scales. Laboratory instrumentation has also been developed to provide researchers with the tools needed to characterize the electrical properties of soil samples and rock cores. Although electrical conductivity (and complex electrical conductivity) is directly related to the charge transport (conduction and polarization) mechanisms in the subsurface, geophysicists measure resistance (or impedance) and historically report resistivity. We follow this historical convention by using resistivity terminology in describing instrumentation and measurements reported here. The measured resistivity is simply the reciprocal of the measured conductivity ($\displaystyle \rho _{m} =\frac{1}{\sigma _{m}}$).

<a href="#fig05">Figure 5</a> represents basic elements of a resistivity measurement. On the left panel, we present a field observation illustration with a setup mirroring the relative semantic layout depicted on the right panel. In this geoelectrical experiment, the pair of injecting electrodes is connected to a direct current (DC) source. The path of the current flow, as generated by this DC source, is represented by dashed lines. As this current permeates through the subsurface, it induces potential differences that can be detected at the surface. These potentials are systematically measured using a high-sensitivity voltmeter. The acquired data, in the form of voltage differences, serve as a proxy for underlying subsurface heterogeneities. Any deviations from the expected profiles—often benchmarked against an idealized or homogeneous case—provide crucial insights into subsurface characteristics and anomalies.

<h3>4) The Resistivity Quadrupole and Apparent Resistivity of Speciﬁc Resistivity
Structures</h4>

In order to develop equations relating four-electrode measurements to the resistivity of the
subsurface, we must ﬁrst understand the spatial pattern of electrical potential due to current injected from an electrode. For a $3D$, isotropic, electrical resistivity distribution, $ρ(x, y, z)$, the electric potential (voltage), $V(x, y, z)$, due to a single (point) current electrode, with strength $I$, located at coordinates $xc, yc, zc$, is deﬁned by $a$ form of the Poisson equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\nabla \left(\frac{1}{\rho } \nabla V\right) =-I\delta ( x_{c} ,\ y_{c} ,\ z_{c})} \tag{1}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq1"></div>

where $\nabla =\frac{\partial }{\partial x} +\frac{\partial }{\partial y} +\frac{\partial }{\partial z}$ and $\delta ( x,\ y,\ z)$ is the Dirac delta function (which takes on a value of 1
at the position x, y, z and is 0 elsewhere).

<a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a> is normally considered to be subject to boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{align*}
{\left(\frac{1}{\rho }\right)\frac{\partial V}{\partial n} =0} \tag{2}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq2"></div>

where $n$ is the outward normal. Such conditions are called Neumann (or second type) and
impose the condition of no ﬂux into or out of the ground (except of course at the current
electrode location).

For the case of homogenous resistivity, $ρ$, with current injection at a depth beyond the
inﬂuence of the ground surface (which is ﬂat and at $z = 0$), the solution of <a href="#eq1">Equation 1</a> gives the voltage at coordinates $x_p ; y_p ; z_p$ as

$$
\begin{align*}
{V( x_{p} ,\ y_{p} ,\ z_{p}) =\frac{I\rho }{4\pi r}} \tag{3}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq3"></div>

where r is the distance between current source and potential measurement, i.e., $r\ =\sqrt{( x_{p} -x_{c})^{2} +( y_{p} -y_{c})^{2} +( z_{p} -z_{c})^{2}}$

The general case where the current is injected at a shallow depth (i.e. the potential ﬁeld is
affected by the non-conducting air at the ground surface) is easily derived by the method of
images. For this case, the solution is the superposition of two solutions using <a href="#eq3">Equation 3</a>: one based on the real electrode at $x_c, y_c, z_c,$ and the other based on an imaginary electrode at
$x_c, y_c, –z_c$. The solution is

$$
\begin{align*}
{V( x_{p} ,\ y_{p} ,\ z_{p}) =\frac{I\rho }{4\pi r} +\frac{I\rho }{4\pi r_{i}}} \tag{4}
\end{align*}
$$
<div id="eq4"></div>

where r is deﬁned as before and $r_i\ =\sqrt{( x_{p} -x_{c})^{2} +( y_{p} -y_{c})^{2} +( z_{p} -z_{c})^{2}}$.

<a href="#eq4">Equation 4</a> is needed for the general case, e.g. where electrodes deployed in boreholes are used, but for the common arrangement of surface electrodes $(z_c = 0, z_p = 0) r_i = r,$ and so

$$
\begin{align*}
{V( x_{p} ,\ y_{p} ,\ 0) =\frac{I\rho }{4\pi r} +\frac{I\rho }{4\pi r} =\frac{I\rho }{2\pi r}} \tag{5}

Resistivity (and IP) measurements are made using a four-electrode conﬁguration: a quadrupole. Two electrodes serve to create the potential field (source and sink current electrodes), and two receiving electrodes are used to measure a potential difference. We can use the expressions in <a href="#eq5">Equation 5</a> (or <a href="#eq4">Equation 4</a> for the general case) to determine the relationship between the measured potential difference, the injected current and the resistivity of the subsurface.

The labels A, B, M and N are commonly used for the electrodes in a quadrupole: A is the
current source, B is the current sink and voltage is measured between electrodes M and
N. Examples of such quadrupoles are shown in Figure 4.2. We will discuss choice of
quadrupole geometry in the next section, but ﬁrst we will develop an expression for
apparent resistivity, which is the resistivity of a homogenous subsurface that the measured
voltage and current are equivalent to. That is, the apparent resistivity is only the true
resistivity if the subsurface is homogenous and provided the assumptions used to compute
the apparent resistivity are valid. Below we explain how an apparent resistivity is computed.
For most ﬁeld-based applications, the calculations are made with the assumption of a ﬂat
ground surface and inﬁnite boundaries (a so-called, inﬁnite half space).

Building on Equation 4.5, we can state, through superposition, that the difference in
voltage between electrodes M and N due to current injected between electrodes A and
B (with all electrodes on the ground surface, as in Figure 4.2a) is given by

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta V = V_M - V_N = \frac{1}{2\pi} \left( \frac{1}{AM} - \frac{1}{BM} - \frac{1}{AN} + \frac{1}{BN} \right) \tag{6} 
\end{equation}
$$
<div id="eq6"></div>

where AM is the distance between electrodes A and M, BM is the distance between
electrodes B and M, etc., and the subsurface is homogenous with resistivity ρ.
Using Equation 4.6 an expression for the apparent resistivity, ρa , can be rewritten as

$$
\begin{equation}
\rho_a = \frac{K \Delta V}{I} \tag{7}
\end{equation}
$$
<div id="eq7"></div>

where K is the geometric factor, with dimensions of length,

$$
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{AM} - \frac{1}{BM} - \frac{1}{AN} + \frac{1}{BN}} \tag{8}
\end{equation}
$$
<div id="eq8"></div>

The term ΔV I is often referred to as a transfer resistance since it has units of ohms.
For the general case where electrodes are not on the ground surface (e.g. Figure 4.2b), we
can follow the same principles using Equation 4.4 to derive

$$
\begin{equation}
K = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{AM} + \frac{1}{Ai_M} - \frac{1}{BM} - \frac{1}{Bi_M} - \frac{1}{AN} - \frac{1}{Ai_N} + \frac{1}{BN} + \frac{1}{Bi_N}} \tag{9}
\end{equation}
$$
<div id="eq9"></div>

where AiM is the distance between imaginary electrode Ai and electrode M, BiM is the
distance between imaginary electrode Bi and electrode M, etc., as shown in Figure 4.2b.
Apparent resistivity is a convenient value for ﬁeld measurements as it has the same units
as resistivity (Ωm), can allow the ﬁeld operator to gauge variability of measurements
directly in the ﬁeld, and allow some immediate assessment of data quality (the apparent
resistivity, for example, should be positive, even for a highly heterogeneous resistivity
structure, provided the geometry designated is correct). Most ﬁeld instruments report
apparent resistivity during measurements, provided the user has supplied details of elec-
trode geometry. However, it is important to note that the computation of apparent resistivity,
as described above, assumes a ﬂat ground surface and an inﬁnite half space. If topographic
variation exists at the site, or if the region of investigation is bounded in some way, then the
reported apparent resistivity does not reﬂect the true resistivity of the subsurface even if it
has a homogeneous resistivity. And in some such conﬁgurations the computed apparent
resistivity may even be negative, which is clearly non-physically correct. An example of
a bounded system is a vessel (see e.g. Figure 3.26) – in such a case, Equation 4.3 is not
a correct solution to Poisson’s equation and analytical solutions for the particular geometry may not be possible. This may be overcome by deriving numerical approximations to
Poisson’s equation for the speciﬁc problem geometry.

As stated earlier, apparent resistivity is a convenient value for ﬁeld measurements but the
true measurement (that should be recorded for all surveys) is the transfer resistance, R = ΔV/
I: the ratio of measured potential difference to applied current. The transfer resistance
(measured in Ω) can be positive or negative (a negative value implies a negative geometric
factor) and can vary by orders of magnitude even if the resistivity is uniform. Recognizing
that the transfer resistance may be negative is important for non-standard conﬁgurations of
electrodes as some commercial instruments do not report the polarity of the transfer
resistance (or voltage) under default settings.
